# Term project for CPSC6175 Web Engineering Technologies

## Concept
Our app is designed to offer users an interactive way to learn about countries around the world. Through detailed country profiles, and customized search filters, users can explore the diversity of cultures, languages, geographies, and economies globally.

## API Used
REST Countries API at https://restcountries.com/

## Key Technologies
* React
* React-Router
* Zustand
* amCharts
* Spring Boot

## Setup
No API key is needed as the REST Countries API does not require one. Simply clone the repository and build/run. The application will default to port 8080.

```
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
The Maven configuration will take care of triggering the install of packages from NPM, running webpack build, building the Spring app, and starting the application.
